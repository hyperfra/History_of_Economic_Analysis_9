                        > The majority of the economic oscillations which we encounter seem to
                        > be explained most plausibly as free oscillations.

                        > oscillation, we have to distinguish between two fundamental problems:
                        > first, the **propagation** problem; second, the **impulse** problem. The
                        > propagation problem is the problem of explaining by the structural

                        > would be in case the system was started in some initial situation.

                        > a system all the variables belong to the same point of time.
                         In one respect, however, must the dynamic system be similar to the Walrasian: it must be **determinate**.

                        > I believe that the theoretical dynamic laws do have a meaning-much of the reasoning on which they are based are on a priori grounds so plausible that it is too improbable that they will have no significance. But they must not be taken as an immediate explanation of the oscillating phenomena we observe, They only form one element of the explanation: they solve the propagation problem. But the impulse problem remains.

                        In dynamic settings the marginalization of the joint probability
                        distribution of the data is essential to overcome the time
                        interdependence between the observations.

                        Start by the distribution of the first observation to be
                        $f_{X_{0}}(X_{0};\psi)$ (in a stationary environment think of the
                        unconditional distribution) then consider writing the joint distribution
                        of the first and second observation as the production of the conditional
                        distribution and the marginal distribution:
                        
                        `$$\begin{aligned}
                        f_{X_{1}}(X_{1},X_{0};\psi) & =f_{X_{1}|X_{0}}\left(X_{1}|X_{0};\psi\right)f_{X_{0}}(X_{0};\psi)\end{aligned}$$`

                        from distribution and the marginal distribution: 
                        
                        `$$\begin{aligned}
                        f_{X_{1}}(X_{1},X_{0};\psi) & =f_{X_{1}|X_{0}}\left(X_{1}|X_{0};\psi\right)f_{X_{0}}(X_{0};\psi)\end{aligned}$$`

                        you can do that for the whole sample and get

                        `$$f_{X^{T}}(X^{T};\psi)=f_{X_{0}}(X_{0};\psi)\prod_{t=1}^{T}f_{X_{t}|X_{t-1}}\left(X_{t}|X_{t-1};\psi\right)$$`

                        or in logs

                        `$$L(\psi)=log\left(f_{X_{0}}(X_{0};\psi)\right)+\sum_{t=1}^{T}log\left(f_{X_{t}|X_{t-1}}\left(X_{t}|X_{t-1};\psi\right)\right)$$`

                        `$$X_{t}=A+BX_{t-1}+V_{t}$$` where $V_{t}\sim N\left(0,\Omega\right)$, and

                        which you can write in terms of the structural model as
                        `$$\begin{aligned}
                        L(\psi) & =-\left(Tn/2\right)+\left(T/2\right)log\left|\Gamma_{0}\right|^{2}-\left(T/2\right)log\left|D\right|\\

                        and find the parameters by maximizing it (can use the reduced form if
                        exactly identified, order and rank condition)
